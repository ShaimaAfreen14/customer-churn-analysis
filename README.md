# customer-churn-analysis

Project background and context

  The aim of the project is to analyze the customer churn for a company. Basically customer churn analysis is the process of measuring the rate at which customer leaves      the product, site or service. A customer is very important for the growth of any business. So, analyzing the cause for churn is very important. Here, I am using Power    BI to transform and analyze the data.

Problems you want to find answers:

1.What is the cause for churn.

2.How can we stop the churning.
